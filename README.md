Let's imagine you're owning a supermarket mall and through membership cards, you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score, which is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

The main aim of this problem is learning the purpose of the customer segmentation concepts, also known as market basket analysis, trying to understand customers and sepparate them in different groups according to their preferences, and once the division is done, this information can be given to marketing team so they can plan the strategy accordingly.

# Data Information
This dataset is composed by the following five features:

**CustomerID**: Unique ID assigned to the customer

**Gender**: Gender of the customer

**Age**: Age of the customer

**Annual Income (k$)**: Annual Income of the customer

**Spending Score (1-100)**: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

# Conclusions For This Project
After developing a solution for this problem, we have come to the following conclusions:

KMeans Clustering is a powerful technique in order to achieve a decent customer segmentation.
Customer segmentation is a good way to understand the behaviour of different customers and plan a good marketing strategy accordingly.
There isn't much difference between the spending score of women and men, which leads us to think, that our behaviour is pretty similarwhen it comes to shopping.
Observing the clustering graphic, it can be clearly observed that the ones who spend more money in malls are young people.
That is to say they are the main target when it comes to marketing, so doing deeper studies about what they are interested, may give more profits.
Althought young people seem to be the one who are spending more.
Promoting discounts on some shops can be something of interest to those who don't actually spend a lot and they may end up spending more.
